# Bluesky Video Upload Status Report

**Date:** May 25, 2025  
**Package:** n8n-nodes-bluesky  
**Bluesky API Version:** @atproto/api 0.15.8

## Summary

Video uploads to Bluesky are **technically successful but functionally broken**. Videos upload as binary blobs but display as "Video not found" on the Bluesky platform.

## Root Cause

Bluesky requires videos to be processed through a specialized video processing pipeline that:
- Generates streaming playlists (`.m3u8` files)
- Creates thumbnail images
- Processes videos for different quality levels
- Provides proper video embed structure (`app.bsky.embed.video#view`)

**The video processing APIs are not yet deployed on Bluesky's servers**, despite the infrastructure existing in their codebase.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **Authentication** - Login and session management
- **Blob uploads** - Videos upload successfully as binary data
- **API integration** - Client-side video API methods are available
- **File validation** - Size limits and format checking work correctly

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
- **Video display** - All uploaded videos show "Video not found" 
- **Video processing** - No thumbnail generation or playlist creation
- **Server APIs** - All video endpoints return `XRPCNotSupported` (404)

### üîç Confirmed via Testing
```
Video API Endpoint Status (May 25, 2025):
‚Ä¢ app.bsky.video.uploadVideo: XRPCNotSupported ‚ùå
‚Ä¢ app.bsky.video.getUploadLimits: XRPCNotSupported ‚ùå  
‚Ä¢ app.bsky.video.getJobStatus: XRPCNotSupported ‚ùå
‚Ä¢ com.atproto.repo.uploadBlob: Working ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Details

### Expected Video Processing Flow
1. Upload video via `app.bsky.video.uploadVideo`
2. Receive job ID for processing status
3. Video gets processed (transcoding, thumbnail generation)
4. Embed structure includes playlist URL and thumbnail
5. Video displays properly in Bluesky feeds

### Current Workaround Flow  
1. Upload video via `com.atproto.repo.uploadBlob` 
2. Create post with video blob reference
3. Video appears in post but shows "Video not found" when clicked
4. No processing occurs (no playlist, no thumbnail)

## Implementation Status

### Infrastructure Ready
Analysis of Bluesky's GitHub repository shows complete video infrastructure:
- Database migrations for video tables ‚úÖ
- Video processing pipeline code ‚úÖ
- Playlist and thumbnail generation ‚úÖ
- Client-side API methods ‚úÖ

### Server Deployment Pending
- Video API endpoints not deployed ‚ùå
- Processing pipeline not active ‚ùå
- Database tables may not be migrated ‚ùå

## Recommendations

### For n8n Users
1. **Avoid video uploads** until Bluesky enables video processing
2. **Use images instead** for visual content (images work perfectly)
3. **Monitor Bluesky announcements** for video feature availability
4. **Test periodically** as deployment could happen without notice

### For Developers
1. **Implementation is ready** - Code will work once Bluesky deploys servers
2. **No changes needed** - Current optimistic approach will activate automatically
3. **Monitor API responses** - Watch for status changes from `XRPCNotSupported`

## Future Outlook

### Positive Signs
- Complete infrastructure exists in Bluesky codebase
- Recent database migrations (January 2025) suggest active development
- Client APIs are fully defined and tested
- Video feature is clearly planned and architected

### Timeline
- **Unknown** - Bluesky hasn't announced video feature timeline
- **Infrastructure ready** - Technical foundation is complete
- **Deployment pending** - Waiting for server-side activation

## Workaround Options

### None Currently Available
- **Third-party hosting**: Videos hosted elsewhere can't be embedded natively
- **Link sharing**: Users can share video links but no inline playback
- **Image alternatives**: Use video thumbnails with external links

## Testing Results

```bash
# Video API Status Test Results (May 25, 2025)
‚úó getUploadLimits: Not implemented (XRPCNotSupported)
‚úó uploadVideo: Not implemented (XRPCNotSupported)  
‚úó getJobStatus: Not implemented (XRPCNotSupported)
‚úì Blob upload: Working (CID: bafkreiduupnmxpc4fwtrfmwpcxbtk5cnydn4vy7r66oebj7hqqs2kf6c4m)

CONCLUSION:
‚Ä¢ Video APIs: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (all return XRPCNotSupported)
‚Ä¢ Blob uploads: WORKING (but videos show "Video not found" on Bluesky)
‚Ä¢ Root cause: Videos need proper processing pipeline for display
‚Ä¢ Status: Infrastructure exists in code, awaiting server deployment
```
