# n8n-nodes-bluesky-enhanced v1.7.0

Release date: 2025-09-10

## Highlights
- Replies now support media (images or a single video) and website cards.
- Cleaner, more reliable media handling across posts and replies.
- Developer workflow uses @n8n/node-cli; editor menu export fixed to avoid undefined/duplicates.

## Added
- Reply operation: media and website card support.
  - Attach images (up to 4) or a single video; prevents mixing images and video in one reply.
  - Alt text for media; image aspect ratio included when available.

## Changed
- Centralized helpers for media items and website cards (clearer validation, better errors).
- More robust binary checks and Buffer validation before uploads.
- Cleaner embed assembly for images and video.

## Developer Experience
- Adopted @n8n/node-cli for dev, lint, build, and release.
- Fixed editor menu export: `index.js` exports class constructors from `dist/` so n8n can read node/credentials descriptions.
- Prevent auto-discovery duplicates: keep only the wrapper under `nodes/Bluesky/Bluesky.node.ts`; move V1/V2 classes to `src/`.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Upgrade notes
- Stop your n8n instance, update the package to 1.7.0, then restart.
- Verify the editor catalog shows a single "Bluesky" node (no undefined/duplicates).

## Thanks
- Includes refactors and fixes inspired by commit 99e230e.
