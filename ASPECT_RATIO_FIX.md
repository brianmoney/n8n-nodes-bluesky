# Aspect Ratio Fix for Image Uploads

## Problem
A user reported an issue where the aspect ratio of photos was not maintained when posting images to Bluesky. This was because the original code uploaded images without providing aspect ratio metadata to the Bluesky API.

## Investigation
Research into the Bluesky API documentation revealed that the `app.bsky.embed.images` schema supports an optional `aspectRatio` field for each image. The aspect ratio is defined as an object with `width` and `height` integer properties that represent the image's aspect ratio.

## Solution
Implemented automatic aspect ratio detection and inclusion in image uploads:

### Changes Made

1. **Added image-size dependency**
   - Added `image-size` package to `package.json` for reading image dimensions
   - This is a lightweight, well-maintained library that can read dimensions from image buffers

2. **Enhanced binaryUploadHelper.ts**
   - Added import for `image-size` library
   - Updated function signature to return aspect ratio information
   - Added dimension detection logic using `sizeOf()` function
   - Graceful error handling - continues upload even if aspect ratio detection fails
   - Added debug logging for dimension detection

3. **Updated postOperations.ts**
   - Added import for the improved upload helper
   - Updated image embed type to include optional `aspectRatio` field
   - Replaced direct upload logic with the improved helper function
   - Modified image embed creation to include aspect ratio when available

### Technical Details

- **Aspect Ratio Detection**: Uses the `image-size` library to read image dimensions from the binary buffer before upload
- **Error Handling**: If dimension detection fails, the upload continues without aspect ratio metadata (non-breaking)
- **API Compliance**: Follows the Bluesky API schema exactly with `{ width: number, height: number }` format
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead as dimension reading is very fast for most image formats

### Testing
- Project builds successfully without compilation errors
- Linting passes without issues
- Aspect ratio detection verified with test image

## Benefits
- Images now maintain their correct aspect ratio when displayed on Bluesky
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Graceful degradation if aspect ratio detection fails
- Better user experience for image posts

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added image-size dependency
- `nodes/Bluesky/V2/binaryUploadHelper.ts` - Enhanced with aspect ratio detection
- `nodes/Bluesky/V2/postOperations.ts` - Updated to use improved upload helper

## Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible
- Works with all existing image upload workflows
- Does not affect video uploads or other media types
