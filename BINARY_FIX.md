# Binary Media Upload Fix

This fix addresses an issue where images weren't being properly included in Bluesky posts.

## Issue Details

The problem occurred in the media handling code. When a user attempted to post with media, the binary data wasn't being correctly processed and uploaded to Bluesky's servers, even though the post text was successfully posted.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced Binary Data Validation**: Added more thorough validation of binary properties to ensure the binary data exists and is accessible.

2. **Improved Error Reporting**: Added detailed error messages that explain exactly what's missing when binary data can't be found.

3. **Extended Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the media upload and post creation process to help diagnose issues.

4. **Fixed Buffer Handling**: Ensured that binary data buffers are properly validated before upload attempts.

## How to Test

1. Set up a workflow with a node that provides binary data (like Google Drive, HTTP Request, etc.)
2. Connect it to the Bluesky node
3. Configure the Bluesky node:
   - Select "Post" operation
   - Enable "Include Media"
   - Set "Binary Property" to match the property name from the previous node (usually "data")
   - Add alt text if desired

The post should now successfully include the image.

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues, check the n8n logs for detailed debugging information. Look for messages with the `[DEBUG]` prefix to trace the execution flow.
